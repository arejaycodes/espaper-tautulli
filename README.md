# espaper-tautulli

a modification of the ESPaper project by Daniel Eichhorn to also display live information from a Tautulli instance

Project designed to add Plex server and stream information by querying the Tautulli API. 

Still a work in progress. Eventually want to not rely on PHP scripts at all, and have all the JSON parsing done on the ESP itself using ArduinoJson. Due to the size of the reply from the Tautulli API however, not sure if it's possible.
